+ Project summary: In the project, we explore seven algorithms in the field of machine learning fairness. They are Learning fair representations (LFR)，Maximizing accuracy under fairness constraints (C-SVM and C-LR)，Maximizing fairness under accuracy constraints (gamma and Fine-gamma)，Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment and Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM and DM-sen)，Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (PR)，Handling Conditional Discrimination (LM and LPS) and Information Theoretic Measures for Fairness-aware Feature selection (FFS).
