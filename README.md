+ Project summary: Supervised learning uses historical data to infer a relation between an instance and its label. However, historical data might contains distriminatory relations. If we directly use those data to train our classifiers, the model predictions will also be biased. Thus, we explored 2 major algorithms in the field of machine learning fairness. Maximizing accuracy under fairness constraints (A2), and Handling Conditional Discrimination (A6) . Under A6, 2 techniques, local massaging and local preferential sampling are applied. We chose Calibritaion to be our evaluation metrics. Among all techniques, we believe local preferential sampling outputs the best results.
